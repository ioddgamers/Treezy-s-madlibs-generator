 In this project, I put the python basics learnt so far to use in creating a madlibs generator. These include:
 - creating variables
 - using input() functions.
 - using f-strings

   I am happy with how the project turned out and impressed by how far I have come, I look forward to creating more
   programs like this on my journey.
